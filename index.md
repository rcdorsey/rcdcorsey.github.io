## Who am I?

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Canterbury, supervised by Michele Bannister with associate supervisors Samantha Lawler (University of Regina, Canada) and Alex Parker (SETI Institute).

My research involves using debiased Solar System surveys to further understand the small bodies in our planetary system, which are leftover pieces from the early Solar System's formation and evolution.

## Outside of astronomy

#### Fun Fact: My favourite astronomical object is the Sombrero Galaxy (:
