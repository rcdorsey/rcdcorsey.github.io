I am currently researching in the field of Planetary Science as part of my PhD with Michele Bannister at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. My study involves using survey simulators to model the expected detections of various small Solar System body populations by Solar System surveys (such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time) in order to improve our understanding of the orbital populations in the Solar System.

### My previous research projects include:

~ Determining the modes of oscillation of five Southern Pulsating Stars

~ Computational modelling pf the observed geometry of white dwarf accretion disks within eclipsing cataclysmic variable systems for different white dwarf and binary system parameters in order to simulate the light curves of different types of cataclysmic variables

~ Characterising the star EPIC 250088244 and determining its membership to the Upper Scorpius region

~ Determining the spin and orbital periods of two cataclysmic variables

My favourite astronomical object is the Sombrero Galaxy (M104 or NGC 4594):

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

Hello

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
