## Who am I?

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Canterbury, supervised by Michele Bannister with associate supervisors Samantha Lawler (University of Regina, Canada) and Alex Parker (SETI Institute).

My research involves using debiased Solar System surveys to further understand the small bodies in our planetary system, which are leftover pieces from the early Solar System's formation and evolution.

## Outside of astronomy research

Aside from research, I am a teaching assistant for the first year physics and engineering course at the University of Canterbury.

I also assist in many outreach events for the Physics and Astronomy Department, including:

~ Elaine P. Snowden Astronomy school, run for ~20 year 13 students to experience the university campus as well as visiting the University of Canterbury's Mount John Observatory

~ KidsFest, run for children of all ages in the general public in collaboration with the local library to demonstrate physics and astronomy concepts
